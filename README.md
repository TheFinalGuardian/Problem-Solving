# Problem Solving
This repository contains problems I have solved to improve my programming skills.
I am using it to document my progress.
Where these problems can be found is shown by their storage location.

As a sidenote, not all of them will have the best, most intuitive, or perfectly scoring solutions.
Some of them may not even be finished.
This is not a formal complete set of answers, but merely a documentation of my journey, just organized.

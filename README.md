# Problem Solving
This repository contains problems I have solved to improve my programming skills.
I am using it to document my progress.
These problems can all be found online. Some of them will have URLs in the comments. Others, you may search up if yhou wuld like to try them.

As a sidenote, not all of them will have the best, most intuitive, or perfectly scoring solutions.
Some of them may not even be finished.
This is not a formal complete set of answers, but merely a documentation of my journey, just organized.
